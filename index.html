        <div class="subheading mb-5">Psychology Major ðŸ§ </div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Julia Martinez is a first-year student at the University of California: Riverside majoring in Psychology. She chose to major in Psychology in order to better understand the human mind and hopes to use her knowledge to treat and improve peopleâ€™s mental health.  She wants to receive a bachelorâ€™s and masterâ€™s in Psychology and aspires to become a Clinical Psychologist. She is detail-oriented, an effective and attentive listener, and has a passion for helping others. <br><br>

        In Highschool, she was a part of Best Buddies and Spoken Word. Best Buddies is an international nonprofit organization that helps build connections and opportunities for people that have intellectual and developmental disorders. She joined the club because she wanted to create friendships with new people and make a difference in her community. She became a cabinet member in her junior year of high school and mainly worked on fundraising projects and organizing club meetings. She continues to be involved in the club at UC Riverside and hopes to become part of the cabinet there. She enjoys spending time with her buddy, Justin, and they hope they can take a trip to Disneyland in the future since they both love Disney. 

Spoken Word was an organization at her high school that performed and wrote poetry. She competed at the Orange County Regional Youth Slam Event three times, making it to the finals each time and also placing twice. Although she was not a captain in the club, she still gained leadership skills that allowed her to coach and teach her fellow members how to perform poems for the competitions. She currently still writes poetry in her free time and participates in The Verbal Coliseum, the UC Riverside Spoken Word Club. She loves to take part in the multiple showcases that happen on campus to improve her public speaking. She enjoys hiding her truths in metaphors and her poetry is often about mental health and identity. Although Julia is a first-year student at UC Riverside, the classes she has been taking have provided her an exceptional amount of knowledge and skills. Her Introduction to Computers class has helped her understand basic HTML and how to operate Microsoft office.  Her Psychological Methods: Statistical procedures class is difficult but also allow her to understand and interpret statistical graphs.
<br><br>

Outside of school she enjoys spending time with her cat and knitting. She is a novice knitter but will knit you a scarf if asked. Her cat is a two-year-old long-haired orange tabby named Mimi whom she loves more than life itself. She is also an avid lover of the arts and spends time going to various museums and performances. Her favorite Art Museum is the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, better known as LACMA. She enjoys the range of art styles exhibited at the museum from post-impressionist to contemporary to german expressionist. She has also seen Hamilton live at the Pantages Theater in Los Angeles. It is her favorite musical and if challenged, she will sing the entire album. She hopes she to be able to see the show again when it tours in March.
